This section explains you how to export your build to Bloop manually.

You can skip this section if:

- You are using a build tool that has built-in support for Bloop and exports
the build automatically every time there is a change.

- You are using IDEs such as [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals) or
IntelliJ. These tools have automatic support for exporting the build to Bloop through
their "Import Build" or "Import Project" actions. If you are using or
planning these IDEs, import the build in your IDE and skip this section.

If you have your project build and want to try the CLI on it, click on the
build tool you use and keep reading.
