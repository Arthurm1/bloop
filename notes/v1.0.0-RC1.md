**This milestone of Bloop includes changes to the configuration files; you'll need to re-generate
your configuration files if you used a previous version of Bloop. See the [installation
instructions][installation instructions].**

# Install the latest release :candy:

If you're on Mac OS X, upgrade to the latest version with:

```sh
$ brew install scalacenter/bloop/bloop
```

Otherwise, run:

```
$ curl -L https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/releases/download/v1.0.0-RC1/install.py | python
```

Read the complete instructions in our [Installation page][installation instructions].


# Highlights :books:

## [Final version of the configuration format][#529] (by [Jorge Vicente Cantero][@jvican])

Check the finished configuration file format JSON Schema [here](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/blob/c5e24b6616d3515e9685ffb145995051b8d8a744/website/static/bloop-schema.json#L1).

The configuration file format is now considered frozen. All the release candidates will work
with the new configuration file format, meaning that upgrades to 1.0.0-RC2 will not require a
re-generation of the configuration file format.

After 1.0.0, it will be our focus to make *forward and backwards* source compatible changes in the
configuration file format so that users can painlessly upgrade to newer versions of Bloop without:

1. The need to upgrade the bloop version in their build tool integrations.
2. The need to upgrade the bloop server versions to use configuration files generated by newer build
   tool integrations.

Any change to the configuration file format that breaks these invariants will go into a 2.x release.

## Features :building_construction:

### [Set the default main class](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/551) 

You can now set the default main class for Scala.js or Scala Native projects in the configuration file format.

### [Enable users to disable color](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/555) (by [@shamsak58](https://github.com/shamsak58))

Disable colors in your logs by using the `--no-color` CLI flag or exporting the `NO_COLOR`
environment variable. [@shamsak58](https://github.com/shamsak58) was also one of our contributors in
the Scala Center spree.

## Usability improvements

### [Use `-O` as a shorthand syntax for `--optimize`](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/582) (by [Jorge Vicente Cantero][@jvican])

Replace `-o` by `-O` as the default shorthand syntax for `--optimize` because the uppercase `O` is
traditionally used to mean optimization in a large array of tools (for example, Clang or gcc).

## Bugfixes :bug:

### [Upgrade to the latest nailgun version](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/555) (by [Pawe≈Ç Bartkiewicz][@tues])

The latest nailgun version includes [Pawel's change](https://github.com/scalacenter/nailgun/pull/7)
to flush output coming from the server earlier than before. This is important so that scripts that
use pipes can see the data as soon as possible.

### [Update systemd instructions](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/560) (by [David Barri][@japgolly])

David has kindly updated our systemd instructions with a few improvements to make sure that the
services are always up-to-date with the latest Bloop systemd services.

### [Fix total count in test report](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/557/files) (by [Samantha Li](https://github.com/samantha-li))

Samantha is a contributor that attended our [Scala Center
spree](https://github.com/scalacenter/sprees/blob/6dc21c0081a39ba698f808deb68017e554e5a8c3/README.md)
in New York. Samantha contributed a fix to the test reporter because the reporter was not correctly
printing the total number of executed tests.

### [Use Scala 2.10 in Maven plugin](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/pull/577/files) (by [Eugene Platonov](https://github.com/jozic))

The Maven plugin for Bloop now uses Scala 2.10 to avoid a conflict with the Scala 2.10 jars coming
from the [`scala-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/) dependency.

## Contributors :busts_in_silhouette:

According to `git shortlog -sn --no-merges v1.0.0-M11..1.0.0-RC1`, 8 people contributed to this
release: Jorge Vicente Cantero, Tim NIeradzik, David Barri, Eugene Platonov, Martin Duhem, Samantha
Li, Sean Sullivan and shamsak58.
