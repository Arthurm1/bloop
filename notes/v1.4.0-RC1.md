# bloop `v1.4.0-RC1`

`1.4.0-RC1` is a temporary release to test all of the changes that have
happened since `1.3.4` and `1.3.5`. It fixes many bugs, improves overall
performance and adds support for user-facing features such as debugging and
the experimental "offloading compilation from sbt".

If everything goes well after Christmas, `1.4.0` will be released. Release
notes for the final release will be exhaustive and will include all changes
happened since `v1.3.4`.
